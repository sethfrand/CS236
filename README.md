## Course Description ##
Introduction to grammars and parsing; predicate and propositional logic; proof techniques; sets, functions, relations, relational data model; graphs and graph algorithms.

### Learning Outcomes ### 

## Write Code From Diverse Program Components ##

Demonstrate ability to build large programs by writing and integrating code from a diverse spectrum of program components.

## Use Mathematical Structures to Solve Programming Problems ## 

Understand and be conversant with basic discrete mathematical structures (finite state machines, regular expressions, grammars, propositional calculus, proof techniques, predicate calculus, sets, relations, functions, graphs).Write complex programs by using mathematical concepts as the basis for solving programming problems (finite state machines for lexical analysis; grammars for parsing; propositional and predicate calculus for logic programming; sets and algebras for relational databases; algebras, graphs, and topological sorting for optimizing datalog query processing).Incrementally build sophisticated programs by a systematic design process based on discrete mathematics.Design a solution for a programming problem and justify the design as one that is maintainable and extendable by other programmers who understand and are conversant with discrete mathematical structures.
